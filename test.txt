                        My current research is at the intersection of malware and software security and Generative AI, with a strong focus on LLM. 
                        I am intrigued by the challenge of combining classical software security and LLM and generative AI. Besides, I am exploring about LLM security and defense and also ability of code LM to reason and 
                        work with systems and low level languages. My research interests can be broadly categorized as:

                    lot and like to dive deep into things that I find
                    fascinating, ranging from nordic mythology to

                        <p> We investigated changes in human sentiment over two years on Twitter
                            during the COVID-19
                            pandemic by incorporating bimodal analyses of tweets and images.
                            We Collected and annotated tweets over the internet for the timeline of
                            2019-2020 and
                            performed exploratory analysis on the data that portrays the change in
                            sentiment in social
                            media for a large timeline during the pandemic.
                            We also proposed a heuristic that combines rule-based and automated text
                            sentiment
                            classification and our work presents a big picture over the change of
                            sentiment.

                        <p> This research project was also a part of my undergraduate thesis where
                            we worked on Bangla
                            Text Simplification without the need of
                            a parallel corpus. We framed the problem of text Simplification as a
                            style transfer problem
                            and leveraging the parphrase generating model we developed as part
                            of our thesis, we are attempting to simplify complex Bangla texts. As of
                            now, The results
                            look promising and we have identified the potential bottlenecks of the
                            pipeline. We are
                            ameliorating
                            the issues by further experimentations.</p>

                        <!-- <div class="subheading mb-3">CO-Authors: Nazrin Sultana, Abhik Bhattacharya, Dr. Rifat Shahriyar</div> -->
                        <p>The purpose of this study is to use Deep Learning to categorize different
                            SARS-CoV-2 variants
                            based on their primary protein sequences. With the help of a pre-trained
                            ProtTrans model, we
                            first created embeddings for the whole protein sequence. We have
                            utilized LGBM, XGBOOST, and
                            a shallow ANN to train variant classifiers using the embeddings. We
                            trained a mutation
                            predictor by modifying Tempel(a time-series-based model to classify
                            influenza mutations) for
                            our primary protein sequences by incorporating a base Transformer
                            encoder in the codebase
                            beating the baseline predictors
                            in terms of MCC and F1-Score. We used the predictor to generate
                            mutations for further
                            analysis. Currently, we are
                            testing our classifier on the mutated sequences and validating our
                            approach and the
                            write-up.

                    <p> Worked extensively on enterprise AI project with real world data that
                        tackles important business
                        needs. I worked mainly with speech and image
                        data modalities. For the speech project, worked to develop a sound event
                        detection system
                        leveraging pretrained models and
                        contributed to different parts of the pipeline(noise removal techniques
                        exploration, data
                        processing etc). I Also worked on
                        various Image processing-based projects where I was a part of teams to
                        develop custom ID card
                        detector, facial recognition detector
                        as well as financial statement parsing by leveraging exisiting deep learning
                        models and
                        customising according to business needs. I learned to
                        develop pre and post processing of real world image data and came to know
                        the challenges and
                        limitations first hand and also picked up some basic
                        skills about ML in production, it's pipeline and challenges. In the Last
                        days of my internships, I worked with the famous ELK stack to develop custom
                        visualization for
                        internal usage of the company.
